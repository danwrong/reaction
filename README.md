# Reaction

A proof-of-concept React component rendering service.

## Use

1. `npm install`
2. Make sure all of your components are listed in `rts.js`
3. Run `node run serve`

## Things I'd like to do

- Write the components in JSX
- Use ES6 everywhere
- Use React-DOM to allow clientside rendering of the components
